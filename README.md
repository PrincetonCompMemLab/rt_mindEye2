**Overview**

This is a demo of real-time visual image retrievals. The goal of this demo is to demonstrate the viability of integrating a GPU processor within the rtcloud framework to utilize recent advances in machine learning to classify or reconstruct visual information from brain activity. 
This demo utilizes the MindEye2 model developed by Scotti et. al. (2024) to do the real-time machine learning on the brain activity to get precise information about what people are looking at.
